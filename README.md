## Implementation of the group 3 2024 preseason robot using command based
This is meant to serve as a basic idea of how a command based robot can be implemented. The subsystems are very basic, and the code isn't perfect, but every command has documentation. If you plan on using the group 3 bot (aka before it is scrapped), this might be a good starting point for code, as it has been tested and works.
